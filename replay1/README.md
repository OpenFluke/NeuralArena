# PARAGON AI Framework: Proxy Error Propagation Experiment

## Overview

The PARAGON AI Framework is a Go-based neural network library designed for flexible and modular machine learning experiments. This experiment introduces a novel training method, `PropagateProxyError`, which serves as an alternative to traditional gradient-based backpropagation. The method is integrated into the PARAGON framework to support knowledge distillation tasks, where a student network learns to mimic a teacher network without direct access to gradients or teacher logits.

This README documents the `PropagateProxyError` function, its implementation, testing on datasets like MNIST and synthetic tasks (random mapping, XOR, sine function), and its role within the PARAGON framework. The experiment evaluates the method's effectiveness using the framework's Accuracy Deviation Heatmap Distribution (ADHD) metrics.

## Features Added to PARAGON

### `PropagateProxyError` Function

- **Location**: `propagate.go`
- **Purpose**: Provides a lightweight, gradient-free method for updating neural network weights and biases using a proxy input signal and a uniform error signal.
- **Key Features**:
  - Computes an average `proxySignal` from the input to guide weight updates.
  - Applies a uniform error adjustment (`adj = lr * errorSignal * damping`) to biases and weights, clipped to `[-maxUpdate, maxUpdate]`.
  - Decays the `proxySignal` by `proxyDecay` per layer to mimic diminishing error influence in earlier layers.
- **Use Case**: Primarily used for knowledge distillation, enabling a student network to learn from a teacher's outputs using a simple error metric (average absolute error).
- **Parameters**:
  - `input [][]float64`: Input data to compute the proxy signal.
  - `errorSignal float64`: Scalar error magnitude (e.g., average absolute error).
  - `lr float64`: Learning rate.
  - `maxUpdate float64`: Maximum adjustment for stability.
  - `damping float64`: Scaling factor for updates.
  - `proxyDecay float64`: Decay factor for the proxy signal across layers.

### Integration with PARAGON

- **Compatibility**: Works with the `Network` struct, supporting any layer configuration defined by `layerSizes`, `activations`, and `fullyConnected` flags.
- **Evaluation**: Leverages PARAGON's ADHD metrics (`adhd.go`) to assess performance, providing deviation buckets (0-10%, 10-20%, etc.) and a unified ADHD Score.
- **Distillation Workflow**: Integrated into a distillation pipeline (`main.go`) where a student network uses `PropagateProxyError` to mimic a gradient-trained teacher network.
- **Testing Framework**: Added test cases in `main.go` to evaluate `PropagateProxyError` on:
  - MNIST classification
  - Random mapping
  - XOR logic mimicry
  - Sine function approximation

## Experiment Description

### Objective

The experiment evaluates the effectiveness of `PropagateProxyError` as a gradient-free training method for knowledge distillation. It compares the performance of student networks (trained with `PropagateProxyError`) against teacher networks (trained with gradient-based backpropagation) using ADHD Scores.

### Methodology

1. **Teacher Training**:
   - Teachers are trained using PARAGON's `Train` function (`network.go`), which implements standard backpropagation.
   - Tasks: MNIST (10 epochs, learning rate 0.01), random mapping (bias nudging), XOR (bias tweaking), sine function (bias adjustments).
2. **Student Training**:
   - Students use `PropagateProxyError` to adjust weights/biases based on the error between their outputs and the teacher’s outputs.
   - Parameters tested: `MaxUpdate` (0.1, 0.5, 5.0), `Damping` (0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.7), `proxyDecay` (0.9).
3. **Evaluation**:
   - ADHD Scores are computed using `EvaluateModel` and `EvaluateFull` (`adhd.go`, `metrics.go`).
   - Metrics include exact matches, mean absolute error, mean percentage deviation, and deviation buckets.
4. **Test Cases**:
   - **MNIST**: Classification on 28x28 images, evaluating generalization.
   - **Random Mapping**: Synthetic task with random inputs/outputs.
   - **XOR**: Non-linear logic task with 4 input-output pairs.
   - **Sine**: Regression task approximating a sine function over [0, 2π].

### Results

The following ADHD Scores were obtained (higher is better, max 100):

| Task           | Teacher ADHD Score | Student ADHD Score (Best)   | Notes                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| MNIST          | 96.53              | 45.52 (max=0.50, damp=0.70) | Student struggles with complex patterns.            |
| Random Mapping | 100.00             | 45.04                       | Uniform updates limit accuracy.                     |
| XOR Mimicry    | 100.00             | 50.00                       | Poor capture of non-linear boundaries.              |
| Sine Function  | 100.00             | 0.00                        | Complete failure, likely due to `tanh` sensitivity. |

**Key Observations**:

- The teacher networks outperform students significantly, indicating that `PropagateProxyError` is less effective than gradient-based methods.
- Student performance is sensitive to `MaxUpdate` and `Damping`, with best results at higher damping (0.7) for MNIST.
- The method struggles with non-linear tasks (XOR, sine), likely due to uniform error application and lack of activation derivatives.

# Research Findings on PropagateProxyError

## Key Points

- **Function Overview**: `PropagateProxyError` is a custom function in the PARAGON AI framework, designed to update neural network weights and biases without computing gradients, offering a simpler alternative to traditional backpropagation.
- **Primary Use**: It appears to be tailored for knowledge distillation, where a student network learns from a teacher network’s outputs, particularly when gradient information is unavailable.
- **Performance**: Test results suggest it achieves modest success (e.g., 45.52 ADHD Score on MNIST) but underperforms compared to gradient-based methods (e.g., teacher’s 96.53 ADHD Score).
- **Limitations**: Its uniform error application and parameter sensitivity may limit accuracy, especially for complex or non-linear tasks like sine function approximation.
- **Potential**: The method’s simplicity makes it promising for resource-constrained environments, though further refinement is needed for broader applicability.

## What is PropagateProxyError?

`PropagateProxyError` is a method within the PARAGON AI framework, a Go-based neural network library. It adjusts a neural network’s parameters (weights and biases) using a proxy signal derived from the input data’s average, modulated by an error signal and a decay factor. Unlike standard backpropagation, which relies on gradient calculations, this function uses a heuristic approach, making it computationally lighter but less precise.

## Why Use It?

The function is likely designed for scenarios where gradient-based training is impractical, such as:

- **Knowledge Distillation**: Training a student network to mimic a teacher without access to the teacher’s internal gradients.
- **Low-Resource Settings**: Environments where computing power is limited, and gradient calculations are too costly.

## How Effective Is It?

Testing within the PARAGON framework shows mixed results. For example, on the MNIST dataset, student networks using `PropagateProxyError` achieved ADHD Scores (a performance metric) ranging from 9.92 to 45.52, compared to the teacher’s 96.53. Similar gaps appeared in synthetic tasks like XOR logic (50.00 vs. 100.00) and sine function approximation (0.00 vs. 100.00). These findings suggest the method struggles with complex patterns and non-linear relationships, likely due to its simplified error propagation.

## Should You Use It?

If you’re working within the PARAGON framework and need a lightweight training method for distillation or low-resource environments, `PropagateProxyError` could be useful. However, for tasks requiring high accuracy, traditional backpropagation or other gradient-based methods are likely better choices. Tuning its parameters (e.g., damping, maxUpdate) may improve results, but expect some trial and error.

# Comprehensive Research Report on PropagateProxyError

## Introduction

`PropagateProxyError` is a novel function integrated into the PARAGON AI framework, a Go-based neural network library developed for flexible machine learning experiments. Unlike traditional gradient-based backpropagation, which relies on computing derivatives to update network parameters, `PropagateProxyError` employs a gradient-free approach. It uses a proxy signal derived from the input data and a scalar error signal to adjust weights and biases, with a decay mechanism to modulate updates across layers. This report explores the function’s purpose, mechanism, performance, advantages, limitations, and its place within the broader landscape of neural network training methods.

## Functionality and Mechanism

### Function Signature

```go
func (n *Network) PropagateProxyError(input [][]float64, errorSignal, lr, maxUpdate, damping, proxyDecay float64)
```

### Purpose

The primary purpose of `PropagateProxyError` is to provide an alternative training method for neural networks when gradient computation is impractical or undesirable. It is particularly suited for knowledge distillation, where a student network learns to replicate a teacher network’s behavior using only the teacher’s output, without access to internal gradients or logits. The function simplifies the training process by avoiding complex derivative calculations, making it computationally efficient and potentially applicable in resource-constrained environments.

### How It Works

The function operates in three main steps:

1. **Proxy Signal Calculation**:

   - It computes a `proxySignal` by averaging all values in the input `[][]float64`. This scalar represents the input’s overall magnitude and serves as a simplified representation of the input’s influence.
   - If the input is empty, the proxy signal defaults to zero.

2. **Layer-wise Error Propagation**:

   - Starting from the output layer (`n.OutputLayer`) and moving backward to the first hidden layer, the function processes each layer:
     - For each neuron, it calculates an adjustment (`adj = lr * errorSignal * damping`), where:
       - `lr` is the learning rate, controlling update magnitude.
       - `errorSignal` is a scalar error (e.g., average absolute error between predicted and target outputs).
       - `damping` scales the adjustment to stabilize updates.
     - The adjustment is clipped to `[-maxUpdate, maxUpdate]` to prevent excessive changes.
     - The neuron’s bias is updated by adding `adj`.
     - Each input connection’s weight is updated by adding `adj * proxySignal`.
   - This uniform adjustment applies the same error signal across all neurons in a layer, modulated by the proxy signal.

3. **Signal Decay**:
   - After processing a layer, the `proxySignal` is multiplied by `proxyDecay` (typically 0.9), reducing its influence in earlier layers. This mimics the diminishing error impact seen in traditional backpropagation.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter     | Description                                         | Typical Value     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `input`       | 2D slice of input data to compute the proxy signal. | Dataset-dependent |
| `errorSignal` | Scalar error magnitude (e.g., mean absolute error). | Task-dependent    |
| `lr`          | Learning rate, scaling the update magnitude.        | 0.01              |
| `maxUpdate`   | Maximum allowed update to prevent instability.      | 0.1–5.0           |
| `damping`     | Scaling factor to stabilize updates.                | 0.01–0.7          |
| `proxyDecay`  | Decay factor for the proxy signal across layers.    | 0.9               |

## Use Cases

`PropagateProxyError` is designed for specific scenarios within the PARAGON framework:

1. **Knowledge Distillation**:

   - In the provided test cases, the function is used to train student networks to mimic teacher networks on tasks like MNIST classification, random mapping, XOR logic, and sine function approximation. The student computes an error (e.g., mean absolute error) between its output and the teacher’s output and uses `PropagateProxyError` to adjust its parameters.

2. **Resource-Constrained Environments**:

   - Its gradient-free nature makes it suitable for low-power devices or embedded systems where computing gradients is computationally expensive.

3. **Exploratory Research**:

   - The function enables researchers to experiment with alternative training paradigms, exploring how much performance can be achieved without gradients.

4. **Pre-Training Step**:
   - It could serve as an initial weight adjustment method before switching to gradient-based training for fine-tuning.

## Test Results and Performance

The PARAGON framework includes test cases in `main.go` to evaluate `PropagateProxyError` across four tasks. Performance is measured using the Accuracy Deviation Heatmap Distribution (ADHD) Score, a metric that quantifies model accuracy and deviation from expected outputs (higher is better, max 100).

### Test Cases and Results

| Task                  | Teacher ADHD Score | Best Student ADHD Score | Parameters (Best Case)         | Notes                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MNIST Classification  | 96.53              | 45.52                   | `maxUpdate=0.50, damping=0.70` | Student struggles with complex image patterns.                 |
| Random Mapping        | 100.00             | 45.04                   | `maxUpdate=0.50, damping=0.30` | Uniform updates limit accuracy on synthetic data.              |
| XOR Logic Mimicry     | 100.00             | 50.00                   | `maxUpdate=0.50, damping=0.20` | Poor capture of non-linear decision boundaries.                |
| Sine Function Mimicry | 100.00             | 0.00                    | `maxUpdate=0.50, damping=0.30` | Complete failure, likely due to `tanh` activation sensitivity. |

### Analysis

- **MNIST**: The teacher, trained with gradient-based backpropagation, achieves a high ADHD Score (96.53), indicating strong performance. The student’s best score (45.52) suggests moderate learning but highlights the method’s limitations in capturing complex patterns in 28x28 images.
- **Random Mapping**: The synthetic task involves random inputs and outputs, yet the student’s score (45.04) is far below the teacher’s perfect score (100.00), indicating that even simple mappings are challenging.
- **XOR Logic**: XOR is a non-linear task requiring precise weight configurations. The student’s score (50.00) reflects difficulty in learning the correct decision boundaries.
- **Sine Function**: The student’s complete failure (0.00) is notable, likely due to the `tanh` activation’s sensitivity to uniform updates, which may drive outputs to extreme values (e.g., 0.99–1.00).

### Key Observations

- **Performance Gap**: Across all tasks, student networks using `PropagateProxyError` significantly underperform teacher networks trained with gradient-based methods.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: The MNIST results show variation in student performance based on `maxUpdate` and `damping` (e.g., 9.92 at `damping=0.30` vs. 45.52 at `damping=0.70`), indicating the need for careful tuning.
- **Task Complexity**: The method performs relatively better on simpler tasks (e.g., random mapping) but struggles with non-linear tasks (XOR, sine), likely due to its uniform error application.

## Advantages

1. **Simplicity**:
   - The function avoids gradient computations, reducing implementation complexity and computational overhead. It requires only basic arithmetic operations (averaging, multiplication, addition).
2. **Flexibility**:
   - Compatible with any network architecture in the PARAGON framework, as it operates on the `Network` struct’s layers, neurons, and weights.
3. **Stability**:
   - Features like `maxUpdate` clipping and `damping` prevent large, destabilizing updates, making the method robust against numerical issues.
4. **Applicability**:
   - Useful in knowledge distillation scenarios where only output errors are available, as demonstrated in the test cases.

## Limitations

1. **Reduced Accuracy**:
   - The uniform application of the error signal across neurons ignores individual contributions, leading to suboptimal updates compared to gradient-based methods.
2. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - Performance varies significantly with `maxUpdate`, `damping`, and `proxyDecay`, requiring extensive tuning for each task.
3. **Lack of Specificity**:
   - The proxy signal (input average) is a crude approximation, potentially losing critical information (e.g., spatial patterns in MNIST images).
4. **Non-Linear Task Challenges**:
   - The method struggles with tasks requiring precise non-linear mappings (e.g., XOR, sine), as it does not account for activation function derivatives.
5. **No Numerical Stability Checks**:
   - Unlike other PARAGON components (e.g., `ComputeLoss` in `network.go`), the function lacks checks for NaN or infinite values, risking instability with problematic inputs.

## Comparison to Other Methods

To contextualize `PropagateProxyError`, it’s useful to compare it to other neural network training approaches:

1. **Traditional Backpropagation**:

   - **Mechanism**: Computes gradients using the chain rule, propagating errors based on activation derivatives and weight contributions.
   - **Pros**: Highly accurate, widely used, and well-understood.
   - **Cons**: Computationally intensive, especially for deep networks.
   - **Contrast**: `PropagateProxyError` is simpler and faster but less precise, as it uses a uniform error signal instead of per-neuron gradients.

2. **Feedback Alignment**:

   - **Mechanism**: Replaces the transpose of forward weights with random feedback weights for error propagation, reducing computational cost ([Feedback Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01596)).
   - **Pros**: Maintains some gradient-like properties with lower complexity.
   - **Cons**: Still requires some form of error propagation, less accurate than backpropagation.
   - **Contrast**: `PropagateProxyError` is even simpler, using a single proxy signal, but may be less effective due to its lack of neuron-specific feedback.

3. **Target Propagation**:

   - **Mechanism**: Assigns target outputs to each layer and propagates differences between actual and target activations ([Target Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7525)).
   - **Pros**: Can handle non-differentiable layers, potentially more robust for certain architectures.
   - **Cons**: Requires careful target assignment, less common in practice.
   - **Contrast**: `PropagateProxyError` avoids target assignment but loses precision by applying uniform updates.

4. **Synthetic Gradients**:
   - **Mechanism**: Uses a separate model to predict gradients, enabling asynchronous updates ([Synthetic Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343)).
   - **Pros**: Reduces dependency on sequential backpropagation, scalable for distributed systems.
   - **Cons**: Requires training an additional model, adding complexity.
   - **Contrast**: `PropagateProxyError` is simpler, requiring no additional models, but lacks the predictive power of synthetic gradients.

`PropagateProxyError` is unique in its use of a decaying proxy signal derived from the input, a feature not commonly seen in standard training methods. Its closest analogs are heuristic or gradient-free methods, but it appears to be a custom innovation within the PARAGON framework.

## Broader Context

The development of `PropagateProxyError` aligns with ongoing research into efficient neural network training methods. Recent studies, such as those on gradient-free optimization ([Gradient-Free Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01786)), explore alternatives like evolutionary algorithms or random search for training neural networks. While these methods can be effective in specific contexts, they often sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. `PropagateProxyError` fits into this niche, offering a lightweight approach that prioritizes ease of implementation over precision.

In knowledge distillation, methods like those described in [Distillation Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05525) typically rely on soft targets (logits) or intermediate representations, which require gradient access. `PropagateProxyError` bypasses this requirement, making it a novel contribution for distillation in constrained settings, though its performance suggests room for improvement.

## Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance `PropagateProxyError` within the PARAGON framework, consider the following:

1. **Incorporate Per-Neuron Errors**:

   - Modify the function to accept a per-neuron error vector (similar to `Backward` in `network.go`), allowing more precise updates based on individual neuron contributions.

2. **Refine Proxy Signal**:

   - Replace the input average with a more informative signal, such as the activations of the previous layer or a weighted sum based on connection strengths.

3. **Include Activation Derivatives**:

   - Integrate the derivative of the neuron’s activation function (via `activationDerivative` in `act.go`) to better handle non-linear tasks like XOR or sine approximation.

4. **Dynamic Decay**:

   - Make `proxyDecay` layer-dependent (e.g., based on depth or fan-in) or learn it during training to adapt to different network architectures.

5. **Numerical Stability**:

   - Add checks for NaN or infinite values in `proxySignal`, `errorSignal`, and `adj`, similar to `ComputeLoss` in `network.go`.

6. **Batch Processing**:

   - Extend the function to handle mini-batches, averaging errors over multiple samples to improve convergence.

7. **Automated Parameter Tuning**:

   - Implement a hyperparameter search (e.g., grid or random search) to optimize `maxUpdate`, `damping`, and `proxyDecay` for specific tasks.

8. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combine `PropagateProxyError` with gradient-based updates for critical layers (e.g., output layer) to balance simplicity and accuracy.

## Conclusion

`PropagateProxyError` is a promising addition to the PARAGON AI framework, offering a gradient-free training method that simplifies neural network updates. Its primary strength lies in its computational efficiency and applicability to knowledge distillation without gradient access. However, test results reveal significant performance gaps compared to gradient-based methods, particularly for complex or non-linear tasks. The function’s simplicity and stability make it suitable for resource-constrained environments or as a pre-training step, but its accuracy and parameter sensitivity limit its standalone use.

For researchers and developers using the PARAGON framework, `PropagateProxyError` provides a valuable tool for exploring alternative training paradigms. With targeted improvements, such as per-neuron error propagation or refined proxy signals, it could become a more robust option for a wider range of applications. By documenting these findings in your repository, you can provide a clear understanding of the function’s capabilities and guide future enhancements within the PARAGON ecosystem.
