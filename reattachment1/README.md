# Neural Surgery & Reattachment Verification

This program demonstrates a complete lifecycle of **modular neural network surgery** using the `paragon` framework. It features a step-by-step pipeline that performs micro-network extraction, training, verification, and reattachment.

## ⚖️ Features

- Extract a micro-network from any checkpoint layer
- Verify equivalence across 3 forward paths
- Perform micro-network surgery on main network
- Train sub-networks independently
- Reattach trained micro-network
- Confirm end-to-end consistency

---

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Network Setup

- Loads existing `original_network.json` and `modified_network.json` if they exist.
- Otherwise, builds a new neural network: `3 → 8 → 6 → 2`

### Step 2: Micro-Network Extraction

- Extracts a `micro-network` starting from layer 2 (checkpoint layer) to the output.

### Step 3: 3-Way Verification

- Verifies that all 3 paths match:

  - Full forward
  - Forward from checkpoint
  - Micro-network forward

### Step 4: Difference Test

- Ensures that the micro-network's normal (non-checkpoint) input path yields a different output.

### Step 5: Complete Surgery

- Performs complete sub-network replacement.
- Measures output change and saves updated networks.

### Step 6: Training & Reattachment

- Trains the micro-network to intentionally diverge from the original output.
- Reattaches it to the main network, replacing the subgraph from checkpoint → output.

### Step 7: Final Verification

- Confirms that the main network remains internally consistent after reattachment.

## 📄 Sample Output (Success Case)

```bash
🏐 Step 1: Setting up networks...
📅 Created network: 3 → 8 → 6 → 2

🔬 Extracting micro network from current network...
✅ Micro network extracted: 3 layers

🧪 3-Way Verification:
✅ Full vs Checkpoint: MATCH
✅ Checkpoint vs Micro: MATCH
✅ Full vs Micro: MATCH
🎉 ALL THREE OUTPUTS MATCH PERFECTLY!

📊 Difference Test:
✅ Normal vs Checkpoint path DIFFER

🚀 Complete Surgery:
🔧 Surgery modified output by: ~0.0775

🏋️ Training Micro-Network:
🎯 Target output intentionally different
🔧 Post-training micro output: changed significantly

🔗 Reattaching:
✅ Weights copied back to main network
✅ Main network output updated

🔍 Final Verification:
✅ Main network full forward == checkpoint forward
🎉 REATTACHMENT VERIFICATION PASSED!
```

## ❓ Why Did It Say "Outputs Don't Match" On Reload?

After saving and reloading the `modified_network.json`, the program loads the **original micro-network** (from `original_network.json`) and compares it against the **newly modified network**.

Since we trained and reattached a new micro-network, this comparison is expected to fail:

```bash
❌ Main-Checkpoint vs Micro-Checkpoint: MISMATCH
❌ Full vs Micro-Checkpoint: MISMATCH
⚠️ OUTPUTS DON'T MATCH - Investigation needed
```

This isn't an error. It's proof that the modified network has changed after training, **which was the goal.**
